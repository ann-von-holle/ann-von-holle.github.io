Predictive exposure models that use factors such as supplement use, lifestyle, and blood donation that have been associated with iron status, may provide a more feasible alternative for studying health effects associated with iron status.  **Methods:** Using three serum iron measures (iron (mg/dL), ferritin (mg/dL), and transferrin saturation (%)) collected at study entry in the US-wide Sister Study, we estimated associations with common iron predictors at baseline with simple age-adjusted multivariable linear regression models or splines depending on fit for women who were postmenopausal at study entry (n=2,088). **Results:** Positive linear associations with log transformed serum ferritin (coefficient; 95% CI) included alcoholic drinks per month (0.004; 0.003, 0.006), meat consumption (per 16 ounces per day) (0.006; 0.004, 0.009), and body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) (0.003; -0.003, 0.009). Inverse associations included history of blood donation (-0.19; -0.26, -0.12), ever-diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia (-0.17; -0.25, -0.09), current hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use (-0.17; -0.26, -0.07), dietary and supplemental calcium (dg) (-0.012; -0.018, -0.007), and exercise (hours per month) (-0.001; -0.003, 0.002). Serum ferritin increased until around 20 months since the last menstrual period then declined. Directions of association for these predictors were similar for iron and transferrin saturation outcomes except for BMI, HRT, and exercise. The R2 indicating proportion of variance in outcome explained by the predictors was 0.08 for iron, 0.10 for ferritin and 0.08 for transferrin saturation.  **Summary:** Common predictors of iron status largely match expected directions of association, but they do not explain a large proportion of variance of serum iron indicators commonly used in clinical practice.","tags":["biomarkers","iron"],"title":"Predictive models for iron status in postmenopausal women","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624280400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624280400,"objectID":"8dc52f6fbb070ad679d5a2e08ed47391","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/202106-ser1/","publishdate":"2021-06-21T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/202106-ser1/","section":"poster","summary":"For epidemiologic studies, iron measurements are often based on serum. Toenails offer a convenient alternative to serum because of ease of collection, transport, and storage. No study has examined the correlation between the serum and toenail measures for iron. Our aim was to compare measures using serum and toenails iron measures on a cross-sectional and longitudinal basis. Using a sample from the US-wide prospective Sister Study cohort, we compared trace iron levels in toenails with three serum biomarkers: iron, ferritin and percent transferrin saturation. Participants (N=281) donated both blood and toenails at baseline (2003-2009) and a subsample (59%, n=165) provided specimens again about 8 (IQR: 7,9) years later. Cross-sectional analyses included Spearman's rank correlation to assess nail/serum association and coefficient of variation comparisons. We also considered maintenance of rank across time separately for nails and for serum, and compared Spearman's correlation coefficients of repeated measures for nail and serum values. Overall, nail and serum iron values did not correlate well with each other. Spearman correlations at baseline (follow-up) were 0.09 (0.04) for serum iron, 0.11 (0.02) for transferrin saturation, and -0.08 (0.01) for ferritin. Nail measures at baseline (follow-up) had a higher coefficient of variation 1.22 (0.94) than serum iron 0.36 (0.33), ferritin 1.01 (0.93), and transferrin saturation 0.38 (0.33). The Spearman correlation for nail iron between repeats across the two time points (0.47, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.60) was higher than for serum iron (0.25, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.39), transferrin saturation (0.33, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.47), and ferritin (0.45, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.58). Based on cross-sectional and repeated assessments, iron measures based on serum did not correlate with those based on toenails. Toenail iron measures appear to be repeatable, but cannot be taken as a proxy for serum iron values and may represent different mechanisms of iron storage.

Extremely high iron stores are associated with increased risk of some cancers. Epidemiologic studies of associations between iron levels and breast cancer are both sparse and inconsistent. A recent meta-analysis found positive associations between serum iron biomarkers and breast cancer, but heterogeneity among studies. Our aim was to assess breast cancer incidence in relation to three serum iron biomarkers: iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation in a prospective cohort study. We sampled participants in the Sister Study, a cohort of 50,884 women aged 35-74 who had never had breast cancer themselves but had an affected sister. The case-cohort sample of 5,982 women, including 2,995 incident cases, had been followed for a median of 7.9 years. Serum iron biomarkers were measured in baseline samples.

Using an age-time-dependent variable in a Cox regression model, we estimated hazard ratios for breast cancer when participants were near their sister’s diagnosis age, relative to similarly aged women whose sister was diagnosed at a very different age. To rule out a correlation driven by young-onset familial cancer, we separately investigated women who had enrolled at age 50 or older. **Results** Of the 23,145 women, 1,412 developed breast cancer during follow-up (median 9.5 years). The estimated hazard ratio was 1.80 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 2.74) at their sister’s age at diagnosis, suggesting a substantial increase in risk compared to women of the same age but whose sister was diagnosed at a very different age.  Restriction to women who enrolled at or after age 50 produced similar results. **Conclusion** This familial clustering suggests that there may be important genetic and/or early environmental risk factors that influence the timing of breast cancer, even when onset is late in life. Personalized screening might need to account for the age at which a sister was earlier diagnosed with breast cancer.","tags":["incidence","breast cancer","familial clustering"],"title":"Evidence for familial clustering in breast cancer age of onset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Von Holle","Katie M.

Evidence based on a comprehensive set of iron biomarkers and a large sample size could help clarify relationships between iron body stores and breast cancer risk. **Methods** A case-cohort sample of 6,008 women, including 3,011 incident cases, has been followed for a median of 7.9 years. We estimated breast cancer hazard ratios (HRs) with Cox models including age as the primary time scale and including in turn iron, ferritin, percent transferrin saturation, and their first principal component both as categorical (quartiles) and continuous measures. **Results** Adjusted HRs for the highest versus lowest quartiles of iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (95% CI) were 1.06 (0.90, 1.25), 1.03 (0.87, 1.23), and 0.94 (0.80, 1.12), respectively, and 1.06 (0.90, 1.25) for the first principal component. Associations were similar when follow-up time was restricted to ≤4 years or 2 years. Post-hoc analyses suggested low iron stores are associated with reduced breast cancer risk, in both pre- and postmenopause and the obese. **Conclusion** A study with one of the largest sample sizes to date and with all three measures of circulating iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation does not support a strong association between elevated iron stores and breast cancer risk. Further investigation of low iron may be warranted. **Impact** These results do not support a strong association between iron overload and breast cancer incidence.","tags":["breast cancer","incidence","biomarkers","iron"],"title":"Association between serum iron biomarkers and breast cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Von Holle","Kari E North","Sheila Gahagan","Raquel Burrows","Estela Blanco","Betsy Lozoff","Annie Green Howard","Anne Justice","Misa Graff","Saroja Voruganti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"d5d20be84aa461b6d2f1df8ef2a1336c","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/publication/journal-article2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article2/","section":"publication","summary":"**Objectives**: Infant anthropometric growth varies across socioeconomic factors, including maternal education and income, and may serve as an indicator of environmental influences in early life with long-term health consequences.

However, these Z-scores, calculated from cross-sectional data, may introduce methodological limitations when used in the context of longitudinal analyses. We assessed analytic limitations when analyzing infant growth data with three anthropometric measures: weight and the corresponding Z-scores and percentiles from a standard. Methods: We undertook a series of Monte Carlo simulations and compared tests of differences in postnatal weight change across time (growth velocity) between two exposure groups. Models with the observed weight outcome were compared to the corresponding weight World Health Organization (WHO) Z-score or weight percentile outcomes. We calculated power, type I error, and median product term coefficient estimates to assess differences between the models. Results: There was lower power to detect velocity differences across exposure groups for WHO Z-scores and percentiles as outcomes compared to the use of observed weight values. We also noted instances in which velocity differences between exposed and unexposed groups were in the opposite direction in analyses with WHO Z-score outcomes. Conclusions: In our simulations of infant weight velocity differences across exposure groups, we observed lower power and effect inconsistencies when applying a standard-derived Z-score transformation. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of the appropriate scale when assessing infant growth trajectories across categorical groups.","tags":["growth trajectories","Z-scores","infant growth"],"title":"The perils of standardizing infant weight to assess weight change differences across exposure groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527858000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527858000,"objectID":"87e271abceeaa86f6dc145d201f0800b","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2018-ser/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2018-ser/","section":"poster","summary":"Background: Infant growth varies across socioeconomic factors including maternal education and income, serving as an indicator of environmental influence in early life with long term health consequences.

We assessed gene-environment interaction in an additive model within: 1) SITAR including product terms that accurately reflects the trichotomous genetic term, and 2) LGMM using stratified SNP-lipid associations by latent growth patterns. Bonferroni-corrected significant findings are reported.\n**Results**: SITAR models did not reveal any evidence of gene-environment interaction. In contrast, given three LGMM patterns of growth, gene-environment interactions emerge for both weight and WFL trajectories. One group of infants had lower velocity but higher acceleration; another group had medium velocity and lower acceleration; a third group had high velocity and lower acceleration. The association between the rs7412 (APOE) variant and HDL (mg/dL) was negative for the low velocity/high acceleration weight trajectory group (mean= -10.2; 95% CI = -16.0, -4.5; n~23) compared to the high velocity/low acceleration group (mean = 11.3; 95% CI = 2.6, 20; n~152). Similarly, the association (95% CI) between the rs78536982 (BAI3, LMBRD1) variant and triglycerides (log(mg/dL) was lower for the low velocity/high acceleration WFL group (-0.61; 0.84, -0.37; n~24) when compared to both the medium velocity/low acceleration (-0.09; -0.23, 0.05; n~271) and high velocity/low acceleration (0.001; -0.11, 0.11; n~189).

Consideration of the multivariate distribution of these lipid traits could be informative for studies involving pleiotropic genetic variants, variants associated with more than one lipid outcome, but featuring only univariate lipid outcome models. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is one way to characterize the multivariate distribution of biologically plausible, related indicators such as lipids with a continuous latent factor. Although CFA has been used to characterize metabolic syndrome, a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor involving many correlated indicators, dyslipidemia is a CVD risk factor that remains relatively unexplored in this literature. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to conduct CFA with LDL-C, HDL-C and TG as indicators representing a single continuous latent lipid factor and assess its suitability as an outcome measure in a United States representative sample by racial/ethnic groups stratified by age and gender over five 2-year time periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012) from NHANES.

Lipid traits are highly heritable and there are currently 185 established loci influencing lipid levels in adults. Recent studies have confirmed that variants associated with lipids influence lipid levels across the lifecourse, and in ancestrally diverse populations. Given that Hispanic/Latinos (HL) shoulder much of the cardiometabolic burden in the United States, it is important to identify genetic variants that contribute the greatest risk for elevated lipid levels across life stages. Thus, our primary aim is to examine the association of known lipid variants with lipid traits identified in large study of adult participants from a Chilean infancy cohort of primarily European-descent. The sample assessed from 2008 to 2013 (n=546) had genotyping and well-measured lipid phenotypes (median age: 16.8 years, interquartile range: 16.6, 16.9). We assessed single variant associations using linear regression for high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), assuming an additive genetic model, adjusted for sex. Additionally, we regressed phenotypes onto weighted trait-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). Only six variants from the Chilean sample met the a priori threshold of power  0.8. We found statistically significant effect sizes (mmol/l (se)) for four of the six variants: rs3764261 (0.16 (0.04)) and rs1532085 (0.05 (0.04)) for HDL and rs1260326 (0.34 (0.15)) and rs964184 (0.33 (0.15)) for TG. For each significant variant, direction of effect matched the multiethnic adult GWAS from which SNPs were selected. We compared our findings to a previous study in Finnish children at age 18 years (n=1,216) and found an opposite direction of effect for our significant HDL variants. Likewise, when comparing coefficients for the PRS between the Chilean and Finnish youth sample we found the association to be stronger in the Chilean sample for every trait and gender group with the exception of LDL for males. The lipid loci explained the least amount of total variance for LDL (males=4% and females=5%) and the most amount of variance for HDL (males=20% and females=14%). In conclusion, there is evidence that lipid loci from a HL sample of adolescents contain similar associations as those from European children and adults. Despite the small sample size and possibility for bias with different ancestral groups we found meaningful and statistically significant associations relating lipid loci in a HL cohort of Chilean adolescents with those found in European ancestral groups. These associations emphasize the importance of adolescence as a time for disease prevention given studies demonstrating both the persistence of associations between PRS and lipids over the life course and the increasing role PRS plays in predicting disease.","tags":[],"title":"Lipid-related Genetic Variants and Lipid Outcomes in a Cohort of Chilean Children","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464786000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464786000,"objectID":"aec729e9f38b7e9abc0df5d5060f2415","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2016-ser/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2016-ser/","section":"poster","summary":"Child growth trajectories are a frequently used metric in life course epidemiology. Z-scores, of weight, length or a combination of the two, are measures typically used when modeling growth trajectories. In terms of parsimony, advantages of Z-scores on a cross-sectional basis include linear scale properties and the ability to combine genders in one model without additional covariates. As a result, Z-scores are frequently used in modeling infant growth, but their properties relative to crude measurements have not been fully explored. We undertook a series of simulations to compare tests of differences in infant weight change across time (growth velocity) across two exposure groups with a referent model including crude weight as an outcome and time as a continuous measure. Models with weight Z-score or weight percentile outcomes were then compared to the referent model using data from three different countries (Portugal, Chile and Italy). To assess differences between the models we calculated power, type I error, and median estimates. Simulation results demonstrate lower power when using Z-scores as an outcome. Also, evidence supports situations in which the crude weight model velocity differences between exposed and unexposed are in the opposite direction of those estimated in the Z-score or percentile model. These contradictory estimates occur when there are group differences in weight at baseline. The Z-score standards were developed for cross-sectional use, and a within-child increase in crude weight over time may not translate to an increase in Z-score or vice versa. This characteristic can help explain the discrepancies in velocity differences across outcome measures. We conclude that infant growth models calculated using Z-scores and percentiles can produce inference contradicting results from models using crude weight measures.

We investigated the association between infant growth from birth to 5 months and lipid levels in adolescents in a Hispanic/Latino cohort to determine if previous findings generalize to diverse study populations and to obtain more detailed growth estimates.\nStudy design\nWe characterized infant growth with monthly measures from birth to five months in males (n=311) and females (n=285) from the Santiago Longitudinal Study (SLS) using three metrics: weight (kg), length (cm) and weight-for-length (g/cm). Nonlinear mixed effects (SITAR) and latent growth mixture models (LGMM) were two approaches to estimate infant growth characteristics. Growth was the exposure and lipid levels at 17 years were the outcomes, including HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, and a TG:HDL-C ratio.\nResults\nWe found a positive relationship between the SITAR length velocity parameter before six months of age and HDL-C levels in adolescence (11.5, SE=4.1) indicating higher HDL-C levels occurring with faster length growth. The strongest associations from the LGMM models were between higher LDL-C and slower WFL growth. However, no associations from the LGMM models were statistically significant after accounting for multiple hypothesis testing. When assessing average lipid values across these latent class groups, most associations pointed towards the faster growth groups having more favorable lipid profiles.\nConclusion\nThis study provides evidence of associations between infant growth from birth to five months and blood lipid profiles during adolescence. In each case, slower growth is associated with adverse lipid profiles - not faster growth as originally hypothesized. Further research with larger samples in this window of time can better distinguish the role of growth in early versus later infancy and childhood as an exposure affecting cardiovascular disease risk factors in adolescence.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e300195e927248bde2d4b98d91bc45ab","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/project/dissertation-aim2/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dissertation-aim2/","section":"project","summary":"Infant Growth Trajectories and Lipid Levels in Adolescence: Evidence from a Chilean Infancy Cohort","tags":["infant growth","lipids","biomarkers","latent growth mixture models","LGMM","SITAR","growth trajectories"],"title":"Aim 2","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Poster presented at American Heart Association Epi|Lifestyle 2018 meeting. Slides created in Overleaf.\nEarly infancy serves as a window of time in which environmental exposures are associated with chronic disease risk factors in adulthood. Infant weight growth during this time has been associated with lipid levels in both animal models and observational studies in humans. Epigenetic modification is one mechanism explaining this association, which results in metabolic programming. Extensive studies support functional association between genetic regions and lipid levels. Infant growth may influence genetic mechanisms and subsequent metabolic programming of lipid metabolism.\nHypothesis: Infant growth influences the strength of association between selected genetic variants and adverse lipid levels for children.\nAim: Assess SNP-lipid additive association across latent early infancy growth classes for 20 candidate genetic variants underlying lipid metabolism and fasting lipid profiles assessed at average 17 years of age.\nResults\n  Faster weight (pooled) and WFL (female) growth groups: positive association between rs72925845 and HDL-C.\n HDL-C inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Expect negative association with HDL-C given established positive association with TG.    Faster weight growth group: inverse association between rs11076175 and LDL-C.\n LDL-C positively associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Expect positive association with LDL-C given established inverse association with HDL-C.    Summary\n Faster growth appears to be protective against a few deleterious SNP-lipid associations. Heterogeneity of SNP-lipid association across growth patterns in this period suggests plasticity of response on a molecular level.
