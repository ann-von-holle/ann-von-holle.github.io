Although genetic variation may play a key role in the interindividual variability in carotenoid concentrations, few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have focused on carotenoids. We used a random sample (n = 519) of postmenopausal participants in the Sister Study with data on genotypes and plasma carotenoid levels to conduct GWAS for each of five carotenoids (mcg/mL): alpha-carotene, beta- carotene, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein/zeaxanthin. We used linear regression models and an additive genetic model to evaluate associations between 371,532 variants and inverse normal transformed carotenoid concentrations. We found evidence for one genome-wide statistically significant association with the combined carotenoids of lutein and zeaxanthin for rs6564851-C (beta = 0.377, se = 0.059, p = 4.6e-10) and rs6420424-A (beta = 0.334, se = 0.059, p= 2.2e-10), upstream of beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) gene on chromosome 16. No other variant was associated with any of the remaining four carotenoids. Our results for the common rs6564851 and rs6420424 variants correspond to previous findings.

Exactly when this reversal occurs in relation to menopause is unclear. Locating that change point could provide insight into the role of adiposity in breast cancer  etiology. METHODS: We examined the association between BMI and breast cancer risk in the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group, from age 45 up to breast cancer diagnosis, loss to follow-up, death, or age 55, whichever came first. Analyses included 609,880 women in 16 prospective studies, including 9956 who developed breast cancer before age 55. We fitted three BMI hazard ratio (HR) models over age-time: constant, linear, or nonlinear (via splines), applying piecewise exponential additive mixed models, with age as the primary time scale. We divided person-time into four strata: premenopause; postmenopause due to natural menopause; postmenopause because of interventional loss of ovarian function (bilateral oophorectomy (BO) or chemotherapy); postmenopause due to hysterectomy without BO. Sensitivity analyses included stratifying by BMI in young adulthood, or excluding women using menopausal hormone therapy. RESULTS: The constant BMI HR model provided the best fit for all four menopausal status groups. Under this model, the estimated association between a five-unit increment in BMI and breast cancer risk was HR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.89) before menopause, HR=1.00 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.04) after natural menopause, HR=0.99 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.05) after interventional loss of ovarian function, and HR=0.88 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.02) after hysterectomy without BO. CONCLUSION: The BMI breast cancer HRs remained less than or near one during the 45-55 year age range indicating that the transition to a positive association between BMI and risk occurs after age 55.","tags":["cancer","BMI","breast cancer","postmenopause","time-to-event models"],"title":"BMI and breast cancer risk around age at menopause","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Von Holle","O'Brien KM","Sandler DP","Janicek R","Karagas MR","Niehoff NM","Levine KE","Jackson BP","Weinberg CR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705276800,"objectID":"41e1599cafdb3013cb1e512a9badf1fa","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/publication/journal-article6/","publishdate":"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article6/","section":"publication","summary":"Serum iron is often assessed in epidemiologic studies, both as an exposure associated with diseases such as cancer and as an outcome indicating iron deficiency or overload. Toenails offer a convenient alternative to serum because of ease of collection, transport, and storage. Very few contemporary studies have examined the correlation between serum and toenail measures for trace metals. Our aim was to compare iron measures using serum and toenails on both a cross-sectional and longitudinal basis. Using a subset of the US-wide prospective Sister Study cohort, we compared iron levels in toenails with three common serum biomarkers: iron, ferritin and percent transferrin saturation. Among 146 participants who donated both blood and toenails at baseline, a subsample (59%) again provided specimens of both about 8 years later. Cross-sectional analyses included Spearman's rank correlations between toenail and serum levels. We also considered maintenance of rank across time separately for toenails and for the serum measures. Overall, toenail values were not correlated with serum iron measures. Spearman correlations at baseline (follow-up) were 0.08 (0.09) for serum iron, 0.08 (0.07) for transferrin saturation, and -0.09 (-0.17) for ferritin. The Spearman correlation for toenail iron between the two time points was higher (0.47, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.64) than for serum iron (0.30, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.51) and transferrin saturation (0.34, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.54), but lower than that for ferritin (0.58, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73). Based on cross-sectional and repeated assessments, our evidence does not support an association between serum and toenail iron measures. Toenail iron measures did appear to be moderately repeatable but cannot be taken as a proxy for serum iron values and those exposure biomarkers may represent different compartments of iron storage.","tags":["iron","biomarkers","mixed-effects models","serum","toenail"],"title":"Toenail and serum levels as biomarkers of iron status in pre- and postmenopausal women: Correlations and stability over eight-year follow-up","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Von Holle","Thompson RL","O'Brien KM","Sandler DP","Weinberg CR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702944000,"objectID":"841d5e04e34ea395095fdcdac436706f","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/publication/journal-article7/","publishdate":"2023-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article7/","section":"publication","summary":"Excess iron has been shown to promote tumor growth in animals whereas iron deficiency has been associated with reduced or slowed tumor growth. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the associations between serum iron biomarkers and tumor size at diagnosis and metastatic status in a sample of breast cancer cases from The Sister Study. The analytic sample included 2,494 incident breast cancer cases with information on tumor size and iron biomarkers, including serum iron (mcg/dL), ferritin (mcg/dL), and percent transferrin saturation, measured in serum collected at baseline. We used Spearman's rank correlation and linear regression models to assess the associations between 1 standard deviation changes in serum iron biomarker levels and natural log of tumor size (cm) adjusting for BMI and age at study entry. We did not find strong associations between any of the three serum iron biomarkers and tumor size. Adjusted regression slopes (95% confidence interval) were -0.016 (-0.048, 0.016) for serum iron, -0.032 (-0.064, \u003c0.001) for ferritin, and -0.010 (-0.043, 0.023) for transferrin saturation. This study did not provide evidence supporting the hypothesis of a positive association between breast cancer tumor size at diagnosis and prediagnostic serum iron levels. Conflicting evidence between this study and previous research in animal models suggests that iron in the human tumor microenvironment may operate independently of circulating iron or body iron stores. Iron has shown pro-tumorigenic activity in animal models, but our data do not support a positive relationship between breast tumor growth and iron status.","tags":["iron","breast neoplasms","breast cancer","ferritin","transferrin","linear models"],"title":"Associations between Serum Iron Biomarkers and Breast Cancer Tumor Size","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ann Von Holle","O'Brien KM","Janicek R","Weinberg CR"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697068800,"objectID":"c7c8c54da00bdad820ef8524096a3193","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/publication/journal-article8/","publishdate":"2023-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article8/","section":"publication","summary":"Serum iron levels can be important contributors to health outcomes, but it is not often feasible to rely on blood-based measures for a large epidemiologic study.

When menopause was included in the predictive model for the sample, the R2 was 0.31 for ferritin.

There is little research about the seasonality of metals and trace elements when assessed in toenail samples. Adjusting for such patterns in models for estimating associations between long-term exposures and health outcomes can potentially improve precision and reduce bias. Objectives: Assess and describe seasonal patterns in toenail measurements of trace elements. Methods: The Sister Study enrolled women residing in the US, including Puerto Rico, whose sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer. At the time of enrollment, participants removed nail polish and collected their toenail clippings, which were cleaned before analysis. We considered the following elements: iron, vanadium, aluminum, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, antimony, mercury, and lead. For two subsamples of the cohort, we fit trigonometric regression models with toenail element measures as the outcome, using sine and cosine functions of the collection day (transformed to an angle) to capture seasonal patterns. These models can estimate the amplitude and timing of the peaks in measures. We evaluated the evidence for a seasonal effect by comparing for each measured element the trigonometric model to a model that was constant across time. Results: There was a seasonal trend in toenail element concentration for iron, aluminum, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, arsenic, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, and lead, all of which peaked near mid-August. Seasonal patterns were concordant across two non-overlapping samples of women, analyzed in different labs. Discussion: Given the evidence supporting seasonal patterns for 11 of the 17 elements measured in toenails, correcting for seasonality of toenail levels of those trace elements in models estimating the association between those exposures and health outcomes is important. The basis for higher concentrations in toenails collected during the summer remains unknown.","tags":["trace elements","seasonal patterns","measurement error"],"title":"Seasonal patterns in trace elements assessed in toenails","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654088400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654088400,"objectID":"eb656e99c5984be040395dc6c6bbab52","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/202206-ser/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/202206-ser/","section":"poster","summary":"High body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) is associated with increased risk of breast cancer after menopause and decreased risk prior to menopause. How risk changes near the menopausal transition (typically around age 50 years) is unclear and further investigation can help to understand the role of adiposity in breast cancer risk. We examined the association between BMI and breast cancer risk in the Premenopausal Breast Cancer Collaborative Group, considering person-time from age 40 years up to breast cancer diagnosis, loss to follow-up, death, or age 55, whichever came first. We used data from 479,132 women in 15 prospective studies, including 11,358 who developed breast cancer before age 55. We used piecewise exponential additive mixed models with age as the primary time scale to estimate three BMI hazard ratios (HRs): constant, linear over age-time, or nonlinear (via splines). Person-time was divided into three menopausal groups: premenopause, natural menopause, or menopause due to interventional loss of ovarian function (surgery or chemotherapy). Sensitivity analyses included adjusting for BMI in young adulthood, excluding those using hormone replacement therapy, and using time since menopause as the age-time scale. The constant BMI HR model provided the best fit (Akaike’s criterion) for all three menopausal status groups. Under this model, the estimated association between a one unit increment in BMI and breast cancer was HR=0.96 (95% CI: 0.96, 0.97) before menopause, HR=0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.00) after natural menopause, and HR=0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.00) after interventional menopause. The sensitivity analyses largely confirmed these results. The BMI breast cancer HRs remain less than one during the 40-55 year age range typically associated with the transition to menopause, suggesting that the expected positive association between higher BMI and breast cancer among postmenopausal women develops after this time period.","tags":["BMI","breast cancer"],"title":"Characterizing the association between BMI and breast cancer risk by menopause status and age-time","type":"poster"},{"authors":["Ann Von Holle","Kari E.

Using a sample from the US-wide prospective Sister Study cohort, we compared trace iron levels in toenails with three serum biomarkers: iron, ferritin and percent transferrin saturation.

Size and timing changes represent vertical and horizontal growth curve shifts, respectively, and velocity change represents growth rate shifts. We estimated the linear association between growth parameters and gestational age, maternal age, education and socioeconomic position (SEP). **Results**: Lower SEP was associated with a slower linear (length) velocity growth parameter (−0.22, 95% CI –0.31 to –0.13)—outcome units are per cent change in velocity from the average growth curve. Lower SEP was associated with later WFL growth timing as demonstrated through the tempo growth parameter for females (0.25, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.42)—outcome units are shifts in days from the average growth curve. We found no evidence of associations between SEP and the weight size, timing or velocity growth rate parameters. **Conclusion**: Previous research on growth in older infants and children shows associations between lower SEP with slower length velocity.

This association suggests that there are important shared genetic and environmental contributions to age at onset.","tags":["breast cancer","familial clustering","incidence"],"title":"Familial aggregation of age of onset for breast cancer risk","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic Academic | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

However, these Z-scores, calculated from cross-sectional data, may introduce methodological limitations when used in the context of longitudinal analyses. We assessed analytic limitations when analyzing infant growth data with three anthropometric measures: weight and the corresponding Z-scores and percentiles from a standard. Methods: We undertook a series of Monte Carlo simulations and compared tests of differences in postnatal weight change across time (growth velocity) between two exposure groups. Models with the observed weight outcome were compared to the corresponding weight World Health Organization (WHO) Z-score or weight percentile outcomes. We calculated power, type I error, and median product term coefficient estimates to assess differences between the models. Results: There was lower power to detect velocity differences across exposure groups for WHO Z-scores and percentiles as outcomes compared to the use of observed weight values. We also noted instances in which velocity differences between exposed and unexposed groups were in the opposite direction in analyses with WHO Z-score outcomes. Conclusions: In our simulations of infant weight velocity differences across exposure groups, we observed lower power and effect inconsistencies when applying a standard-derived Z-score transformation. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of the appropriate scale when assessing infant growth trajectories across categorical groups.","tags":["growth trajectories","Z-scores","infant growth"],"title":"The perils of standardizing infant weight to assess weight change differences across exposure groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527858000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527858000,"objectID":"87e271abceeaa86f6dc145d201f0800b","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2018-ser/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2018-ser/","section":"poster","summary":"Background: Infant growth varies across socioeconomic factors including maternal education and income, serving as an indicator of environmental influence in early life with long term health consequences. Previous research has identified sociodemographic gradients in growth with a focus on the first year and beyond, but estimates are sparse for growth before 6 months. Methods: Participants (n=l,412) were from a randomized iron deficiency anemia prevention trial in healthy infants from low- to middle-income neighborhoods in Santiago, Chile (1991-1996). Anthropometric measures included monthly weight (kg), length (cm) and weight-for-length (WFL) values from 0 to 5 months. For each measure, we estimated 3 individual-level growth parameters (size, timing and velocity) as outcomes from Superimposition by Translation and Rotation (SITAR) models. Subsequently, we used lasso regression with post-selection inference methods to estimate the linear association between each of the growth parameter outcomes and covariates including gestational age, maternal age, education, and socioeconomic position (SEP). We used a false discovery rate=0.05 to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: Lower SEP was associated with higher length velocity growth parameters for both males (0.21, 95% Cl=0.14,0.37), females (0.17, 95% Cl=0.05,0.31), and the pooled sample (0.22, 95% Cl=0.13,0.31) -- outcome units are percent increase in velocity above the average growth curve. Lower SEP was also associated with slower growth timing for females (0.25, 95% Cl=0.05,0.42) -- outcome units are shifts in days from the average growth curve. Conclusion: Previous research on growth in older infants and children shows positive associations between income and/or maternal education with length velocity. We found evidence supporting an opposite direction of association at an earlier age, which may inform age-specific prevention efforts aimed at infant growth.","tags":["infant growth","sociodemographic","SITAR","growth trajectories"],"title":"Sociodemographic predictors of early postnatal growth","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519909200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519909200,"objectID":"68585f054dcc15fc633e23606e6e0e6f","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2018-aha/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2018-aha/","section":"poster","summary":"**Background**: The postnatal period can function as a window of time for metabolic programming.

We assessed gene-environment interaction in an additive model within: 1) SITAR including product terms that accurately reflects the trichotomous genetic term, and 2) LGMM using stratified SNP-lipid associations by latent growth patterns. Bonferroni-corrected significant findings are reported.\n**Results**: SITAR models did not reveal any evidence of gene-environment interaction. In contrast, given three LGMM patterns of growth, gene-environment interactions emerge for both weight and WFL trajectories. One group of infants had lower velocity but higher acceleration; another group had medium velocity and lower acceleration; a third group had high velocity and lower acceleration. The association between the rs7412 (APOE) variant and HDL (mg/dL) was negative for the low velocity/high acceleration weight trajectory group (mean= -10.2; 95% CI = -16.0, -4.5; n~23) compared to the high velocity/low acceleration group (mean = 11.3; 95% CI = 2.6, 20; n~152). Similarly, the association (95% CI) between the rs78536982 (BAI3, LMBRD1) variant and triglycerides (log(mg/dL) was lower for the low velocity/high acceleration WFL group (-0.61; 0.84, -0.37; n~24) when compared to both the medium velocity/low acceleration (-0.09; -0.23, 0.05; n~271) and high velocity/low acceleration (0.001; -0.11, 0.11; n~189).

To date, most reports draw on European ancestry cohorts with few observations of early growth. To determine if previous findings generalize to diverse study populations and to accommodate more detailed growth estimates, we investigated the association between monthly infant growth from birth to 5 months and dyslipidemia in adolescents in a Hispanic/Latino cohort. We characterized infant growth in males (n=345) and females (n=308) from the Santiago Longitudinal Study (SLS) using three metrics\":\" weight (kg), length (cm) and weight-for-length (g/cm). Nonlinear mixed effects (SITAR) and latent growth mixture models (LGMM) were two approaches to estimate infant growth characteristics. Growth functioned as an exposure and lipid levels at 17 years were the outcome, including HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG. We used a false discovery rate of 0.05 to report findings. Height trajectories presented the strongest evidence for an effect on dyslipidemia in adolescence in both the SITAR and LGMM models. SITAR analyses demonstrated an inverse relationship between height velocity before six months of age and HDL-C levels in adolescence. LGMM models offered more nuanced findings. A two-class height trajectory model offered the best fit\":\" one group (n~268) had shorter length at birth accompanied by lower velocity/higher acceleration; the other group (n~406) had higher length at birth and higher velocity/lower acceleration. The lower velocity/higher acceleration group had lower mean HDL-C (mg/dL) (35.4, se=0.9) than the higher velocity/lower acceleration group (43.8, se=0.7), χ2(1)=36.4, p-value=\u003c0.001. Similarly, the best-fitting 3-class weight trajectory model indicated the lower velocity/medium acceleration group had a higher mean LDL-C (mg/dL) (97.7, se=1.6, n~441) than the highest velocity/lowest acceleration group (88.8, se=2.0, n~202), χ2(1)=15.2, p-value=\u003c0.001. A similar pattern for LDL-C emerged for the weight-for-length trajectories, χ2(1)=8.6, p-value=0.003. This study provides evidence of associations between infant growth from 0 and 5 months and blood lipid profiles during adolescence. Based on two different analytic approaches, characteristics of infant length trajectories were associated with HDL-C at mean age 17 years. These findings align with the well-established relationship between height and CVD in adulthood. Furthermore, groups with higher acceleration in all three trajectory types were more likely to have adverse lipid outcomes. Future research can inform the role of infant body size change in the context of downstream effects and CVD risk.","tags":[],"title":"Infant Growth Trajectories and Lipid Levels in Adolescence: Evidence from a Chilean Infancy Cohort","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488373200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488373200,"objectID":"1db8f0352b7ee0bc546e4d5fcea8c453","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2017-01-cfa/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2017-01-cfa/","section":"poster","summary":"Plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) are important risk factors for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and are widely-used as targets for therapeutic intervention. Consideration of the multivariate distribution of these lipid traits could be informative for studies involving pleiotropic genetic variants, variants associated with more than one lipid outcome, but featuring only univariate lipid outcome models. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is one way to characterize the multivariate distribution of biologically plausible, related indicators such as lipids with a continuous latent factor. Although CFA has been used to characterize metabolic syndrome, a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor involving many correlated indicators, dyslipidemia is a CVD risk factor that remains relatively unexplored in this literature. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to conduct CFA with LDL-C, HDL-C and TG as indicators representing a single continuous latent lipid factor and assess its suitability as an outcome measure in a United States representative sample by racial/ethnic groups stratified by age and gender over five 2-year time periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012) from NHANES. First, we used principal component analyses (PCA) to visually examine clustering by race and gender in biplots. Second, we tested for scale differences in the lipid factor across a) calendar time and b) racial/ethnic groups (Mexican-American, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Other Hispanic and Other race/ethnicity). All analyses were stratified by medication use, gender and three age groups: 12-19 years, 20 to 49 years and 50-80 years, and adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI). We found significant scale differences across racial/ethnic groups. In particular, the center of the distribution differed across racial/ethnic groups for ages 12-19 years (p\u003c0.0001), 20-49 years (p\u003c0.0001) and 50-80 years (p\u003c0.0001), suggesting joint distributions of TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C vary across racial/ethnic groups. In summary, one continuous latent factor representing all three lipids and their concomitant associations provides a means to characterize lipid values simultaneously and can serve as an outcome when studying exposures influencing multiple lipid values, pleiotropic genetic variants being just one example of many. Differences in the lipid latent factor across racial/ethnic groups emphasizes distinct multivariate distributions necessitating stratification. Limited analyses exist using this CFA framework for lipids, and future efforts considering the joint distribution of lipids may improve our understanding of the genetic architecture of dyslipidemia.","tags":[],"title":"Confirmatory Factor Analysis of Multivariate Lipid Distributions Across Time and Race and Ethnic Groups: United States, 2003-2012","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488373200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488373200,"objectID":"3f371ae6d94e2f09ec72901c6d688021","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2017-03-aha/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2017-03-aha/","section":"poster","summary":"Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for chronic cardiometabolic diseases. Lipid traits are highly heritable and there are currently \u003e185 established loci influencing lipid levels in adults. Recent studies have confirmed that variants associated with lipids influence lipid levels across the lifecourse, and in ancestrally diverse populations. Given that Hispanic/Latinos (HL) shoulder much of the cardiometabolic burden in the United States, it is important to identify genetic variants that contribute the greatest risk for elevated lipid levels across life stages. Thus, our primary aim is to examine the association of known lipid variants with lipid traits identified in large study of adult participants from a Chilean infancy cohort of primarily European-descent. The sample assessed from 2008 to 2013 (n=546) had genotyping and well-measured lipid phenotypes (median age: 16.8 years, interquartile range: 16.6, 16.9). We assessed single variant associations using linear regression for high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), assuming an additive genetic model, adjusted for sex. Additionally, we regressed phenotypes onto weighted trait-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). Only six variants from the Chilean sample met the a priori threshold of power \u003e 0.8. We found statistically significant effect sizes (mmol/l (se)) for four of the six variants: rs3764261 (0.16 (0.04)) and rs1532085 (0.05 (0.04)) for HDL and rs1260326 (0.34 (0.15)) and rs964184 (0.33 (0.15)) for TG. For each significant variant, direction of effect matched the multiethnic adult GWAS from which SNPs were selected. We compared our findings to a previous study in Finnish children at age 18 years (n=1,216) and found an opposite direction of effect for our significant HDL variants. Likewise, when comparing coefficients for the PRS between the Chilean and Finnish youth sample we found the association to be stronger in the Chilean sample for every trait and gender group with the exception of LDL for males. The lipid loci explained the least amount of total variance for LDL (males=4% and females=5%) and the most amount of variance for HDL (males=20% and females=14%). In conclusion, there is evidence that lipid loci from a HL sample of adolescents contain similar associations as those from European children and adults. Despite the small sample size and possibility for bias with different ancestral groups we found meaningful and statistically significant associations relating lipid loci in a HL cohort of Chilean adolescents with those found in European ancestral groups. These associations emphasize the importance of adolescence as a time for disease prevention given studies demonstrating both the persistence of associations between PRS and lipids over the life course and the increasing role PRS plays in predicting disease.","tags":[],"title":"Lipid-related Genetic Variants and Lipid Outcomes in a Cohort of Chilean Children","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464786000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464786000,"objectID":"aec729e9f38b7e9abc0df5d5060f2415","permalink":"https://ann-von-holle.github.io/poster/2016-ser/","publishdate":"2016-06-01T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/2016-ser/","section":"poster","summary":"Child growth trajectories are a frequently used metric in life course epidemiology. Z-scores, of weight, length or a combination of the two, are measures typically used when modeling growth trajectories. In terms of parsimony, advantages of Z-scores on a cross-sectional basis include linear scale properties and the ability to combine genders in one model without additional covariates. As a result, Z-scores are frequently used in modeling infant growth, but their properties relative to crude measurements have not been fully explored. We undertook a series of simulations to compare tests of differences in infant weight change across time (growth velocity) across two exposure groups with a referent model including crude weight as an outcome and time as a continuous measure. Models with weight Z-score or weight percentile outcomes were then compared to the referent model using data from three different countries (Portugal, Chile and Italy). To assess differences between the models we calculated power, type I error, and median estimates. Simulation results demonstrate lower power when using Z-scores as an outcome. Also, evidence supports situations in which the crude weight model velocity differences between exposed and unexposed are in the opposite direction of those estimated in the Z-score or percentile model. These contradictory estimates occur when there are group differences in weight at baseline. The Z-score standards were developed for cross-sectional use, and a within-child increase in crude weight over time may not translate to an increase in Z-score or vice versa. This characteristic can help explain the discrepancies in velocity differences across outcome measures. We conclude that infant growth models calculated using Z-scores and percentiles can produce inference contradicting results from models using crude weight measures. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of the appropriate scale when modeling infant growth trajectories.","tags":[],"title":"The utility of standardizing or crude weight measures in modeling of postnatal growth trajectories: are there differences?","type":"poster"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Title: Sociodemographic predictors of early postnatal growth: evidence from a Chilean infancy cohort\nAbstract\nObjectives\nInfant anthropometric growth varies across socioeconomic factors, including maternal education and income, and may serve as an indicator of environmental influences in early life with long term health consequences.
