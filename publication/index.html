    <a href="/publication/journal-article6/">Toenail and serum levels as biomarkers of iron status in pre- and postmenopausal women: Correlations and stability over eight-year follow-up</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Serum iron is often assessed in epidemiologic studies, both as an exposure associated with diseases such as cancer and as an outcome indicating iron deficiency or overload. Toenails offer a convenient alternative to serum because of ease of collection, transport, and storage. Very few contemporary studies have examined the correlation between serum and toenail measures for trace metals. Our aim was to compare iron measures using serum and toenails on both a cross-sectional and longitudinal basis. Using a subset of the US-wide prospective Sister Study cohort, we compared iron levels in toenails with three common serum biomarkers: iron, ferritin and percent transferrin saturation. Among 146 participants who donated both blood and toenails at baseline, a subsample (59%) again provided specimens of both about 8 years later. Cross-sectional analyses included Spearman’s rank correlations between toenail and serum levels. We also considered maintenance of rank across time separately for toenails and for the serum measures. Overall, toenail values were not correlated with serum iron measures. Spearman correlations at baseline (follow-up) were 0.08 (0.09) for serum iron, 0.08 (0.07) for transferrin saturation, and -0.09 (-0.17) for ferritin. The Spearman correlation for toenail iron between the two time points was higher (0.47, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.64) than for serum iron (0.30, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.51) and transferrin saturation (0.34, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.54), but lower than that for ferritin (0.58, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.73). Based on cross-sectional and repeated assessments, our evidence does not support an association between serum and toenail iron measures. Toenail iron measures did appear to be moderately repeatable but cannot be taken as a proxy for serum iron values and those exposure biomarkers may represent different compartments of iron storage.</p>

    <a href="/publication/journal-article7/">Associations between Serum Iron Biomarkers and Breast Cancer Tumor Size</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Excess iron has been shown to promote tumor growth in animals whereas iron deficiency has been associated with reduced or slowed tumor growth. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the associations between serum iron biomarkers and tumor size at diagnosis and metastatic status in a sample of breast cancer cases from The Sister Study. The analytic sample included 2,494 incident breast cancer cases with information on tumor size and iron biomarkers, including serum iron (mcg/dL), ferritin (mcg/dL), and percent transferrin saturation, measured in serum collected at baseline. We used Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation and linear regression models to assess the associations between 1 standard deviation changes in serum iron biomarker levels and natural log of tumor size (cm) adjusting for BMI and age at study entry. We did not find strong associations between any of the three serum iron biomarkers and tumor size. Adjusted regression slopes (95% confidence interval) were -0.016 (-0.048, 0.016) for serum iron, -0.032 (-0.064, &lt;0.001) for ferritin, and -0.010 (-0.043, 0.023) for transferrin saturation. This study did not provide evidence supporting the hypothesis of a positive association between breast cancer tumor size at diagnosis and prediagnostic serum iron levels. Conflicting evidence between this study and previous research in animal models suggests that iron in the human tumor microenvironment may operate independently of circulating iron or body iron stores. Iron has shown pro-tumorigenic activity in animal models, but our data do not support a positive relationship between breast tumor growth and iron status.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Serum iron levels can be important contributors to health outcomes, but it is not often feasible to rely on blood-based measures for a large epidemiologic study. Predictive models that use questionnaire-based factors such as diet, supplement use, recency of blood donation, and medical conditions could potentially provide a noninvasive alternative for studying health effects associated with iron status. We hypothesized that a model based on questionnaire data could predict blood-based measures of iron status biomarkers. Using iron (mcg/dL), ferritin (mcg/dL), and transferrin saturation (%) based on blood collected at study entry, in a subsample from the U.S.-wide Sister Study (n=3171), we developed and validated a prediction model for iron with multivariable linear regression models. Model performance based on these cross-sectional data was weak, with R2 less than 0.10 for serum iron and transferrin saturation, but better for ferritin, with an R2 of 0.13 in premenopausal women and 0.19 in postmenopausal women. When menopause was included in the predictive model for the sample, the R2 was 0.31 for ferritin. Internal validation of the estimates indicated some optimism present in the observed prediction model, implying there would be worse performance when applied to new samples from the same population. Serum iron status is hard to assess based only on questionnaire data. Reducing measurement error in both the exposure and outcome may improve the prediction model performance, but environmental heterogeneity, temporal variation, and genetic heterogeneity in absorption and storage may contribute substantially to iron status.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Growth in early infancy is hypothesized to affect chronic disease risk factors later in life. To date, most reports draw on European-ancestry cohorts with few repeated observations in early infancy. We investigated the association between infant growth before 6 months and lipid levels in adolescents in a Hispanic/Latino cohort. We characterized infant growth from birth to 5 months in male (n = 311) and female (n = 285) infants from the Santiago Longitudinal Study (1991–1996) using 3 metrics: weight (kg), length (cm), and weight-for-length (g/cm). Superimposition by translation and rotation (SITAR) and latent growth mixture models (LGMMs) were used to estimate the association between infant growth characteristics and lipid levels at age 17 years. We found a positive relationship between the SITAR length velocity parameter before 6 months of age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in adolescence (11.5, 95% confidence interval; 3.4, 19.5), indicating higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurring with faster length growth. The strongest associations from the LGMMs were between higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and slower weight-for-length growth, following a pattern of associations between slower growth and adverse lipid profiles. Further research in this window of time can confirm the association between early infant growth as an exposure and adolescent cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p><strong>Background</strong> Familial clustering of age at onset would have implications for both personalized screening and etiology, but has not been studied for breast cancer. <strong>Methods</strong> We prospectively studied a cohort of 23,145 sisters to explore whether their breast cancer risk changed near the age at diagnosis of a previously-affected older sister. Using an age-time-dependent variable in a Cox regression model, we estimated hazard ratios for breast cancer when participants were near their sister’s diagnosis age, relative to similarly aged women whose sister was diagnosed at a very different age. To rule out a correlation driven by young-onset familial cancer, we separately investigated women who had enrolled at age 50 or older. <strong>Results</strong> Of the 23,145 women, 1,412 developed breast cancer during follow-up (median 9.5 years). The estimated hazard ratio was 1.80 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 2.74) at their sister’s age at diagnosis, suggesting a substantial increase in risk compared to women of the same age but whose sister was diagnosed at a very different age.  Restriction to women who enrolled at or after age 50 produced similar results. <strong>Conclusion</strong> This familial clustering suggests that there may be important genetic and/or early environmental risk factors that influence the timing of breast cancer, even when onset is late in life. Personalized screening might need to account for the age at which a sister was earlier diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>

    <a href="/publication/journal-article4/">Association between serum iron biomarkers and breast cancer</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p><strong>Background</strong> Iron is both essential to life and potentially toxic at higher levels. Epidemiologic studies of iron and breast cancer are sparse, with substantial heterogeneity found in a recent meta-analysis. Evidence based on a comprehensive set of iron biomarkers and a large sample size could help clarify relationships between iron body stores and breast cancer risk. <strong>Methods</strong> A case-cohort sample of 6,008 women, including 3,011 incident cases, has been followed for a median of 7.9 years. We estimated breast cancer hazard ratios (HRs) with Cox models including age as the primary time scale and including in turn iron, ferritin, percent transferrin saturation, and their first principal component both as categorical (quartiles) and continuous measures. <strong>Results</strong> Adjusted HRs for the highest versus lowest quartiles of iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (95% CI) were 1.06 (0.90, 1.25), 1.03 (0.87, 1.23), and 0.94 (0.80, 1.12), respectively, and 1.06 (0.90, 1.25) for the first principal component. Associations were similar when follow-up time was restricted to ≤4 years or &gt;2 years. Post-hoc analyses suggested low iron stores are associated with reduced breast cancer risk, in both pre- and postmenopause and the obese. <strong>Conclusion</strong> A study with one of the largest sample sizes to date and with all three measures of circulating iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation does not support a strong association between elevated iron stores and breast cancer risk. Further investigation of low iron may be warranted. <strong>Impact</strong> These results do not support a strong association between iron overload and breast cancer incidence.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Infant anthropometric growth varies across socioeconomic factors, including maternal education and income, and may serve as an indicator of environmental influences in early life with long-term health consequences. Previous research has identified sociodemographic gradients in growth with a focus on the first year and beyond, but estimates are sparse for growth before 6 months. Thus, our objective was to examine the relationship between sociodemographic factors and infant growth patterns between birth and 5 months of age. <strong>Main outcome measures</strong>: Longitudinal anthropometrics including monthly weight (kg), length (cm) and weight-for-length (WFL) values. For each measure, we estimated three individual-level growth parameters (size, timing and velocity) from SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation models. Size and timing changes represent vertical and horizontal growth curve shifts, respectively, and velocity change represents growth rate shifts. We estimated the linear association between growth parameters and gestational age, maternal age, education and socioeconomic position (SEP). <strong>Results</strong>: Lower SEP was associated with a slower linear (length) velocity growth parameter (−0.22, 95% CI –0.31 to –0.13)—outcome units are per cent change in velocity from the average growth curve. Lower SEP was associated with later WFL growth timing as demonstrated through the tempo growth parameter for females (0.25, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.42)—outcome units are shifts in days from the average growth curve. We found no evidence of associations between SEP and the weight size, timing or velocity growth rate parameters. <strong>Conclusion</strong>: Previous research on growth in older infants and children shows associations between lower SEP with slower length velocity. We found evidence supporting this association in the first 5 months of life, which may inform age-specific prevention efforts aimed at infant length growth.</p>

    <a href="/publication/journal-article3/">The perils of standardizing infant weight to assess weight change differences across exposure groups</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Purpose: When conducting analyses of child weight growth trajectories, researchers commonly use Z-scores from a standard instead of the observed weights. However, these Z-scores, calculated from cross-sectional data, may introduce methodological limitations when used in the context of longitudinal analyses. We assessed analytic limitations when analyzing infant growth data with three anthropometric measures: weight and the corresponding Z-scores and percentiles from a standard. Methods: We undertook a series of Monte Carlo simulations and compared tests of differences in postnatal weight change across time (growth velocity) between two exposure groups. Models with the observed weight outcome were compared to the corresponding weight World Health Organization (WHO) Z-score or weight percentile outcomes. We calculated power, type I error, and median product term coefficient estimates to assess differences between the models. Results: There was lower power to detect velocity differences across exposure groups for WHO Z-scores and percentiles as outcomes compared to the use of observed weight values. We also noted instances in which velocity differences between exposed and unexposed groups were in the opposite direction in analyses with WHO Z-score outcomes. Conclusions: In our simulations of infant weight velocity differences across exposure groups, we observed lower power and effect inconsistencies when applying a standard-derived Z-score transformation. These results emphasize the need for careful consideration of the appropriate scale when assessing infant growth trajectories across categorical groups.</p>
