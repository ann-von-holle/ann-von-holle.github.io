  abstract = {Growth in early infancy is hypothesized to affect chronic disease risk factors later in life. To date, most reports draw on European-ancestry cohorts with few repeated observations in early infancy. We investigated the association between infant growth before 6 months and lipid levels in adolescents in a Hispanic/Latino cohort. We characterized infant growth from birth to 5 months in male (n~= 311) and female (n~= 285) infants from the Santiago Longitudinal Study (1991â€“1996) using 3 metrics: weight (kg), length (cm), and weight-for-length (g/cm). Superimposition by translation and rotation (SITAR) and latent growth mixture models (LGMMs) were used to estimate the association between infant growth characteristics and lipid levels at age 17 years. We found a positive relationship between the SITAR length velocity parameter before 6 months of age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in adolescence (11.5, 95\% confidence interval; 3.4, 19.5), indicating higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels occurring with faster length growth. The strongest associations from the LGMMs were between higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and slower weight-for-length growth, following a pattern of associations between slower growth and adverse lipid profiles. Further research in this window of time can confirm the association between early infant growth as an exposure and adolescent cardiovascular disease risk factors.},
