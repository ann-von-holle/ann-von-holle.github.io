  abstract = {Background Seasonal patterns in measured exposure biomarkers can cause measurement error in epidemiological studies. There is little research about the seasonality of metals and trace elements when assessed in toenail samples. Adjusting for such patterns in models for estimating associations between long-term exposures and health outcomes can potentially improve precision and reduce bias. Objectives Assess and describe seasonal patterns in toenail measurements of trace elements. Methods The Sister Study enrolled women residing in the US, including Puerto Rico, whose sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer. At the time of enrollment, participants removed nail polish and collected their toenail clippings, which were cleaned before analysis. We considered the following elements: iron, vanadium, aluminum, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, antimony, mercury, and lead. For two subsamples of the cohort, we fit trigonometric regression models with toenail element measures as the outcome, using sine and cosine functions of the collection day (transformed to an angle) to capture seasonal patterns. These models can estimate the amplitude and timing of the peaks in measures. We evaluated the evidence for a seasonal effect by comparing for each measured element the trigonometric model to a model that was constant across time. Results There was a seasonal trend in toenail element concentration for iron, aluminum, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, arsenic, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, and lead, all of which peaked near mid-August. Seasonal patterns were concordant across two non-overlapping samples of women, analyzed in different labs. Discussion Given the evidence supporting seasonal patterns for 11 of the 17 elements measured in toenails, correcting for seasonality of toenail levels of those trace elements in models estimating the association between those exposures and health outcomes is important. The basis for higher concentrations in toenails collected during the summer remains unknown.},
